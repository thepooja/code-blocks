## Structured concurrency

- “Structured concurrency is a coroutine design principle where child coroutines are bound to a parent scope and automatically cancelled when the parent is cancelled.”

## What are Coroutines?

- Coroutines are lightweight threads for asynchronous programming.
- Coroutines are lightweight — We can run many coroutines on a single thread due to its support for suspension.
- They help:
- Avoid callback hell
- Write sequential async code
- Manage background tasks efficiently
- Coroutines have fewer memory leaks — coroutines follow the structured concurrency principle
- Coroutines offer built-in cancellation support

## Coroutine scopes

## Suspend Function

- Suspending functions are those functions that can be paused and then continued later.

- Suspend functions are only allowed to be called from a coroutine or another suspend function.

## coroutine builders

- Coroutine builders are functions for initialising or creating new coroutines.
- Types of Builders
- launch : launches a new coroutine concurrently, i.e., without blocking the current thread. It’s typically used for fire-and-forget tasks where you don’t need a return value.
- async : launch a new coroutine; the only difference is that it returns a deferred instead of a Job. The deferred is a non-blocking future that promises to deliver the result later. ( use await() function )
- runBlocking: runs a new coroutine and blocks the current thread until its completion
- withContext: It is a suspending function that is used to switch coroutine context within a coroutine. It suspends the current coroutine, switches to the specified context, and resumes execution in the new context.

## Coroutine Dispatcher

- Dispatchers.Main: Runs the coroutine on the main (UI) thread, useful for updating UI elements.
- Dispatchers.IO: IO Dispatchers initiate the coroutine on the IO thread ( e.g - reading or writing files, making database queries, or making network requests)
- Dispatchers.Default: The default dispatcher is used when no other dispatcher is explicitly specified in the scope.
